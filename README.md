How to passthrough a GPU for various Beelink SER miniPCs

I use a few Beelink miniPCs in my homelab, all running Proxmox, but I mainly wanted to be able to send a VM screen to my TV over HDMI.

I found a number of helpful guides along the way with this, and (obviously) any of them might work for you, but I felt like, specifically for the Beelink owners, it might be nice to know that yes, our miniPCs can do this too.
