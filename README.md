How to passthrough a GPU for various Beelink SER miniPCs

## The models which I've tested with (WIP)
Beelink SER5 - AMD Ryzen 5 5500U

## The operating systems which I've tested with
- [x] Arch Linux
- [x] Debian 13
- [x] Pop! OS
- [ ] Windows 11

I use a few Beelink miniPCs in my homelab, all running Proxmox, but I mainly wanted to be able to send a VM screen to my TV over HDMI.  

I found a number of helpful guides along the way with this, and (obviously) any of them might work, but I felt like, specifically for the Beelink owners, it might be nice to know that yes, our miniPCs can do this too.
